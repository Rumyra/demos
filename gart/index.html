				<h1>Gart: The Art Game.</h1>
				<time>November 2020</time>
			</header>

			<p>I organised a date the other day. I know what you're thinking can you <em>date</em> in lockdown? Fortunately I am a live alone single, so I'm allowed a "bubble", this just happens to be the man I'm dating... lucky.</p>

			<p>Now there's not a lot you can do during lockdown, so I created an activity. He likes board games, I like drawing. So I came up with an art game or Gart as I like to call it.</p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>

			<p>The rules are fairly simple: Pick a card and draw or paint whatever it says on the card. Repeat until you need to stop for food.</p>

			<p>I didn't instigate a time limit, although having played it that could easily be an option.</p>

			<h2>What you'll need:</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>The prompt cards. I've created a pdf, or you can use the interactive version below.</li>
				<li>Paper or card.</li>
				<li>Something to draw or paint with (I chose watercolours and felt-tips as they are relatively non-messy.)</li>
			</ul>

			<section id="card-picker">
				<p>Click the button to pick a card. Once a card has been selected it won't be again, refresh the page to start a new game.</p>
				<button>Pick a card</button>
				<div></div>
